The first is to just continue on down the canyon to the intersection with Halls Creek. However this is likely to involve some heavy bushwhacking. The better option is to climb out canyon left shortly after the last rappel (Approx. 150 yards). As you head down canyon keep an eye on canyon left for an area that has some fallen trees and is covered in vines (Oct 2015). This is really the first place you can easily climb out of the canyon on this side. There is a short climb here that may need to be spotted (about 8 feet). Scramble up (North) to the ridge and then down diagonally heading back to Halls Creek.

If you don't have much Class C experience, go do <a href=\"/Seven_Teacups\" title=\"Seven Teacups\">Seven Teacups</a> or do <a href=\"/Big_Creek\" title=\"Big Creek\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Big Creek</a> first to gain experience. And DEFINITELY try to hook up with someone that has done this canyon to go with you; it may well save you a trip to the hospital and months of rehab. Some of the injuries that have happened:\n\n\n<li>Several people have plummeted tens of feet off cliffs after slipping from the edges </li>\n<li>Several people broke legs, ribs, ankles and knees while doing some of the slides</li>\n<li>Several people twisted or dislocated ankles and fingers while walking in the stream</li>\n<li>At least two people have fractured vertebrae in their backs on high jumps -- on the 52' initial and and 32' Black Hole, and both were very experienced canyoneers.</li>\n<li>A person jumped from 6' into pool of water, and hit knee on edge of unseen rock 2-3' below surface. Snapped ligaments in back of his knee.</li>\n<li>A person attempted to swim through the waterfall into the Rainbow Room, panicked in the water and sunk 10' below surface needing a lifeguard rescue.</li>\n<li>A person rappelled straight down the big waterfall (without using the rebelay), had trouble getting off rope at bottom because his pack had no buoyancy. He started gasping and dropped pack to bottom of pool losing the entire pack and all contents.</li>\n<li>A person had their rope sever completely on the sharp edge of the Big Kahuna rappel, free-falling 35'. Luckily landed into water</li>\n\nThere have been multiple helicopter rescues over the years in this canyon due to injuries. DO NOT take any chances if you do not intimately know the canyon. ALWAYS have someone in your group rappel first on rope to scout out a safe place for the others to jump.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Water_Flow\">Water Flow</span>\n\nGauge readings from the sensor in between <a href=\"/Jump_Trip_(Upper)\" title=\"Jump Trip (Upper)\">Upper Jump Trip</a> and <strong class=\"selflink\">Lower Jump Trip</strong> may be found at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.dreamflows.com/graphs/day.450.php\">Dreamflows</a>.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Approach\">Approach</span>\n\nThe drive to Jump Trip is often long (5-6 hours from both Los Angeles and the Bay Area), and the additional necessity of setting a long car shuttle can make for challenging logistics.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Drive_to_campground\">Drive to campground</span>\n\nNote that cell service is poor or non-existent in the entire Jump Trip area.  The nearest reliable cell service is at a turnout atop a hill on Trimmer Springs Rd at 36°53'01.3\"N 119°12'58.0\"W, marked with a sign as \"Cell Site\".\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Black_Rock_campground\">Black Rock campground</span>\n\nBlack Rock campground is currently open, with no fee for camping until further notice.  There is usually water at the campground during the summer, but at times it is turned off. Due to the forest fire in 2016 there is now limited shade.\n\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/sierra/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=66085&amp;actid=29\">Black Rock campground</a> is a $14/night + $5/additional vehicle campsite located near the trail head of <a href=\"/Jump_Trip_(Upper)\" title=\"Jump Trip (Upper)\">Upper Jump Trip</a> and the Black Rock Reservoir.  It is cooler at 4300 ft elevation with shade from many pine trees, but insects are often a problem.\n\nDrive to Balch Camp; this is roughly 1.5 hours from civilization outside the mountains and cell reception is very poor over most of this entire distance.  At Balch Camp, take two vehicles up the road on the right (LDC of the east fork of the river) leading to the power house and park one vehicle in the large dirt area on the river side of the road just before the gate and fences of the power house.  Return to Balch Camp in the second vehicle and take the next turn on the right to cross just one bridge and start heading up the mountain.  After a few switchbacks, the road will parallel the entire Jump Trip route (Lower and Upper) as you ascend with the mountain on your left.  The set of two penstocks (not the single one) indicates the end of Lower Jump Trip.  If this is your first trip, and especially if you are arriving after dark, be very careful on the section of road following the first scary bridge, particularly on a sharp left turn.  Ten miles and ~30 minutes after the bridge in Balch Camp, take the right fork onto a dirt road.  1.2 miles later, you will arrive at Black Rock campground.  There are sites to the left and to the right of the road you drove in on; see the <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/sierra/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=66085&amp;actid=29\">Forest Service web site</a> for details (or just search for Black Rock campground if that link is broken).\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kirch_Flat_campground\">Kirch Flat campground</span>\n\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/sierra/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=45504&amp;actid=29\">Kirch Flat campground</a> is on the main Kings River before you drive up the North Fork.  As of 2023, camping is free but the seasonal camp host is strictly enforcing rules. It is an alternative to Black Rock.  It is approximately 40 minutes closer to civilization than Black Rock making for a shorter drive in and a MUCH easier meeting point for people arriving (typically after dark), but will also be a longer drive up to begin either Upper or Lower Jump Trip in the morning.  Also, it is at 1300 ft elevation making it much warmer than Black Rock.  Partial shade at many of the sites and proximity to the river somewhat mitigates the heat. The campground is first-come and may fill up on weekends. There is no potable water here.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hike_Drop-In\">Hike Drop-In</span>\n\nIn the morning, drive 2.4 miles from Black Rock (or 13.6 miles from Kirch Flat) to the wide dirt parking area with a gated dirt road on its southeast side (36.909594, -119.053449).  Hike on the old road bed beyond the gate 0.8 miles (-540 ft elevation) to the cliffs above the water -- this is the exit of <a href=\"/Jump_Trip_(Upper)\" title=\"Jump Trip (Upper)\">Upper Jump Trip</a> and the start of Lower Jump Trip.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Express_Drop-In\">Express Drop-In</span>\n\nFor a much shorter, steeper and quicker drop-in directly to the Entrance Exam, park at 36.90346, -119.05374 right near the \"winding road\" yellow diamond road sign.  Hike down the boulders immediately beyond the road sign (facing sign, toward Blackrock), down a granite slab with Manzanita on the right.  Follow the well trimmed trail down steeply to the grassy area above the Entrance Exam shelf.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Descent\">Descent</span>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"First_section\">First section</span>\n\nThe first 0.8 miles of Lower Jump Trip contain many of the best parts of the entire canyon.  Any time there is a jump, all but one member of your group can easily avoid it by having one person meat-anchor a rappel.  Before jumping, always have a member of your team check the depth of the pool below.\n\n\n<li> <b>Drop in (aka Entrance Exam)</b>: Rappel from two bolts RDC about a hundred yards to the pool below. Alternately, find a spot RDC slightly up canyon of the bolts and <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd3qQK8Rmu0\">jump 52' into the pool</a>. This jump is referred to as the 'Entrance Exam'.  The entry for such a large jump must be excellent to avoid injury. A third option, and the original jump, was into the small pothole on the right side of the waterfall, 15' - 20'. It is a narrow landing zone made narrower by a boulder hidden in the waterfall froth. Not recommended. There is also a bolted anchor to rappel in here, ~30'. Finally, a fourth recent variation is to edge around to the right below the cliff above you, until you are facing the waterfall. Then it is a clean drop just by stepping off, 20-30'.</li>\n<li> <b>First jump</b>: A hundred yards down canyon of the drop in, jump approximately 24' from the ledges on the LDC of the waterfall. It is also possible to jump on the right from the top of the waterfall itself, but you must jump far enough horizontally to clear the rocks.</li>\n<li> <b>Split falls</b>: AKA \"Jungle Ride\". On the other side of the pool from the first jump, there is a 25' jump that is from between two cascades under normal flow conditions.  This is where the banner picture from this page was taken.</li>\n<li> <b>Climb around</b>: Climb around the next waterfall LDC</li>\n<li> <b>Left turn</b>: The canyon makes an appreciable left turn</li>\n<li> <b>Play jumps</b>: Depending on the route taken, you may need to jump back into the water. You can jump from either side and climb back up to do it again.</li>\n<li> <b>Dead tree anchor</b>: Bolted in 2017. Go to the end of the big pool and exit RDC just before the waterfall.  Climb directly to the right of the water course to ledge.  Using double bolt station, rappel down the slippery RDC side of the waterfall to the large pool below.  The distance from the bolts to the water is around 110'.  In the past, before the tree died and fell and before it was bolted, people climbed around this from the rocky ledge above.</li>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Waterpark\">Waterpark</span>\n\n<li> <b>Pool slide</b>: After having someone check the depth, slide off a 5' ledge just left of center into the pool below</li>\n<li> <b>Person hole</b>: Right above the first of a series of large pothole pools, there is a small pothole filled with water that can fit only one person. You can enter this pothole and usually stand on gravel, and get yourself out.</li>\n<li> <b>Pothole slide</b>: The next pothole has a stream flowing into the top of it, and it is deep enough to slide over the edge and drop</li>\n<li> <b>Washing machine</b>: The final pothole in this section has a swirling current and smooth slippery exit ledge, and you may find yourself and your group circling several times before being able to climb out</li>\n<li> <b>Bumpy slide</b>: Shortly down canyon, there is what appears to be a very nice long slide, but beware that it sends you directly at the right wall and has caused several ankle injuries. It is best to wet the rock on the left of the main watercourse and slide down there. Be prepared for a bumpy descent and be very careful not to injure your ankles by getting them caught during the descent.</li>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Big_drop_section\">Big drop section</span>\n\n<li> <b>Black hole</b>: As you near the big rappel of the canyon, observe the old rusted chain anchor up the rock LDC of the pour-over.  You can rappel from this anchor, or jump 32' from the LDC ledge closest to the pool into the pool below.</li>\n\n<li> <b>Big rappel</b>: <b>Single Stage or Two Stage rappel off sets of bolts:</b>  There is limited room on the rock at the far side of the black hole pool (top of 1st stage); be sure to sequence wisely. At typical flows of the canyon of 12cfs or less, it is easy to swim to the edge and stop yourself without going over.  Climb up LDC well out of the water to bolted anchor with webbing; rappel roughly 130' to the large pool below.  In moderate flows, rappel in the watercourse as it is excellent fun.  Remember <a href=\"/Swift_water\" title=\"Swift water\">swift water techniques</a> and lower your head to create a pocket of breathable air while immersed in the waterfall.  Be sure to avoid any pendulum movement as <b>a number of groups have experienced coreshots while rappelling in the flow</b><sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[1]</a></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-4\">[2]</a></sup>;  <b>Two Stage:</b> It may be wiser to use the rebelay station LDC to reduce the chance of a core shot.  This station is located 30' down from the top anchor on the ledge LDC, and consists of 2x new bolts (further left), 2x very old bolts with chains (a button head with open shut and #12) and 2x 3/8\" stud (not in use).  Note <b>station has been rebolted on 9/3/2017 by Dominik and Itaru</b> with SS 1/2\" powers bolts and SS hangers, much nicer!</li>\n\n<li> <b>Narrows jump</b>: After a few more small jumps or slides, enter the narrows and avoid a difficult descent through a pinch by climbing up RDC on a rock bench.  At the end of the bench, jump approximately 20' into the narrows water course.</li>\n\n<li> <b>No-jump pothole</b>: After the canyon turns left, there is a sequence of potholes to navigate.  One of them looks like an appealing jump, but has a rock that can be dangerously concealed just below the surface.  Make sure to check depths.</li>\n\n<li> <b>Big Kahuna</b>: Do not approach the waterfall just after the potholes directly; instead, follow the rock bench RDC up to a narrow cliff overlooking the pool below.  The canyon register is in this area if you can find it.  Using bolts RDC, rappel 80ft to the pool below.</li>\n\n<li> <b>Slick Jump</b>: Locate a ledge system on LDC, traverse out to the center of ledge, and jump 20' into the LDC side of the pothole below.   The approach to the ledge slopes downward toward the pool and can be extremely slippery -- multiple people have fallen at this spot.  There may be one or more bolts LDC in a small alcove near the ground that can be used for belay out to the edge of the jump, or rappel if necessary.  (A handline was also present here as of early 2020.)</li>\n\n<li> <b>Big Jump</b>: Jump 36' to the pool below from the RDC side of the cliffs, or downclimb to the pool LDC.  Exit the pool on its RDC side at the pourover or along the wall by pulling up on webbing from the bolt on the RDC wall, or cross the waterfall below the pool if you downclimbed.</li>\n\n<li> <b>Rainbow Room</b>: From two bolts on horizontal rock tucked just down canyon of a rock wall, rappel into the Rainbow Room.  The approach to these bolts can be tricky and a belay may be warranted.  A single bolt above the \"Big Jump\" pool can be used to anchor a handline to access the Rainbow Room anchor if the ledge is slippery.  (This bolt was installed with webbing to assist in pulling oneself out of the pool to avoid the pourover in higher flow.)  Be careful of rope pull issues when retrieving the rope; consider swimming or throwing the pull side out and far away from the rappel before <a href=\"/LAPAR\" title=\"LAPAR\" class=\"mw-redirect\">LAPAR</a> rappels.  Swim through the narrow channel under a waterfall and out the other side.  Alternately, downclimb LDC to skip this rappel (but be sure to swim back through the waterfall into the Rainbow Room; it is great fun). Alternatively, jump 55', but the landing is very narrow.</li>\n\n<li> <b>Matrix jump</b>: After exiting the Rainbow Room, jump into the next pool from the RDC side of the waterfall being careful to avoid the submerged rock.</li>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Express_Exit\">Express Exit</span>\n\nFor a short version of Lower Jump Trip, you can climb back up to the road (900 feet gain over 0.35 miles) on a well trimmed trail.  About 200 feet past the Matrix Jump is a corner of rock that is easy to scramble up at 36.89797, -119.06210.  Following this trail takes you to 36.90203, -119.06224 on the road above, about 1/2 mile from the express drop-in; more details in exit section (below).    By using the express drop-in and express exit, Lower Jump can be done non-shuttle, but this cuts off the Middle and Last Section (below).\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Middle_section\">Middle section</span>\n\nThe canyon opens up at this point and there are nearly 2 miles of hiking, creek hopping, downclimbing, and very long pools to swim. Save some energy for this lower section and enjoy the beauty that is there. The following descriptions are only for a few of the most distinctive difficulties or locations. \n\n\n<li> <b>Dry Slide</b>: Downclimb in a crack RDC of a diagonally sloping slab of smooth granite on the right side of a narrow cascade.  Some people also used to scoot out on the dry slope, run down it and then fling themselves into the deep water as it got too steep. The swim following is about 60 yards.</li>\n<li> <b>Long Pool</b>: This pool is about 200 yards which seems like a really long ways to swim with packs and boots.</li>\n<li> <b>The Water Gardens</b>: A place to stop and marvel at how the water has cut intersecting and parallel channels.</li>\n<li> <b>Second Pool</b>: AKA 20th or 30th pool! This swim is about 130 yards long.  The entrance is interesting. A thick rib of dark rock sticks out from the left. The water spirals around the right through 3 potholes. Each is deep enough to drop into, but check first. There is also a jump of 20' from the rib to the bottom pool, but the only deep landing zone is tiny and invisible from above.</li>\n<li> <b>MiniGorge</b>: The canyon starts to close up again but the walking is easy on bedrock.  Pass a giant pothole to the side of the stream.  In 2010 or 2011, a large rockslide clogged the end of this section with sharp edged boulders. There are another slide or two here if you have an eye out for fun...</li>\n<li> <b>Tricky Downclimb</b>: Where the rockslide ends, the stream tumbles down into a small pool cluttered with rocks. Some giant boulders block the downcanyon view, but there are passages underneath them. There are plenty of rocks and horns to anchor a short 15 foot rappel LDC, or there is a moderately difficult crack to downclimb from a ledge on RDC. Rocks have fallen from the hillside and filled in part of the canyon beneath the downclimb. The crack is no longer needed as you can do an easy downclimb on RDC due to the new debris. </li>\n<li> <b>Big pool</b>: Either take a running jump to clear a small tree with rocks directly below, or climb slightly LDC and slide into the pool</li>\n<li> <b>Lateral Downclimb</b>: Downclimb a fairly long and very exposed slab on RDC, typically by climbing up the slab about 40' RDC, traversing across, and back down. Good spot to set a handline or a belay.  Jump into the narrow, hanging pool, then jump into the large pool a few feet below (after checking depth for both).</li>\n<li> <b>Toboggan Warm Up</b>: The hiking changes from rock hopping to bedrock with very easy walking on the RDC shoulder above some very pretty pools. The slabs make for easy walking, but if you have time and energy left, stay in the water course for some great jumps and beautiful swims.</li>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Last_section\">Last section</span>\n\n<li> <b>Pre-Toboggan</b>: As the canyon rounds the corner to face Patterson Creek Falls, the river pools up and then drops ~20 ft, offering a decent jump or an entertaining slide down the watercourse.</li>\n<li> <b>Toboggan</b>: As the canyon opens up, there is a large boulder RDC.  Follow the edge of this boulder around to either side to find a long slide the drops into a pool. The right most slide drops cleanly. After checking the depth, slide down into the pool -- this is one of the most fun features of the canyon.</li>\n<li> <b>Big Waterfall</b>: This cascade is about 300 feet long. There is potential to stay in the watercourse or to do rappels to either side.\n<ul><li> If rappelling in the watercourse, find a single bolt at the top and rappel 135' into the hanging pool.  The bolt is tucked in an upstream crease of rock inches above the water just RDC of the main watercourse.  In July 2018, the bolt was just a stud missing its hanger and nut, about the size of a standard quick link, so likely a 10mm stainless steel Petzl nut.</li></ul></li>\n\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/File:Jump_Trip_(Lower)_BigWaterfallTopRapBolt.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/3/33/Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_BigWaterfallTopRapBolt.jpg/300px-Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_BigWaterfallTopRapBolt.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/3/33/Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_BigWaterfallTopRapBolt.jpg/450px-Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_BigWaterfallTopRapBolt.jpg 1.5x, /images/thumb/3/33/Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_BigWaterfallTopRapBolt.jpg/600px-Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_BigWaterfallTopRapBolt.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1343\" data-file-height=\"893\"></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/File:Jump_Trip_(Lower)_BigWaterfallTopRapBolt.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Big waterfall, first stage anchor</div></div></div> \n\n<li><ul><li> There should be good opportunities for a rock chock anchor far RDC that deposit the canyoneer on the slabs just above the hanging pool.  Or possibly a bush anchor.</li>\n<li> LDC of the main water course, there is a small trickle of water that flows over the cliff edge.  Farther LDC of this trickle is a large indentation with cracks that present a good opportunity for a knot chock.  The fall line of the rope from this anchor meets the trickle of water at the cliff edge and descends to the LDC corner of the hanging pool, a few feet up canyon of the bolt for the second stage.</li>\n<li> Once in the hanging pool (which is out of sight from above, except from far RDC), exit the pool and rappel from a second single bolt on the LDC lip of the pool 125' to the water below.  It is ok for the rope to be 5-15' short as the last part of the rappel is a slide.  As of July 2018, this bolt appeared to be pulled out of the rock by approximately 3mm.</li></ul></li>\n\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/File:Jump_Trip_(Lower)_BigWaterfallBottomRapBolt.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/f/f3/Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_BigWaterfallBottomRapBolt.jpg/300px-Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_BigWaterfallBottomRapBolt.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"165\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/f/f3/Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_BigWaterfallBottomRapBolt.jpg/450px-Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_BigWaterfallBottomRapBolt.jpg 1.5x, /images/thumb/f/f3/Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_BigWaterfallBottomRapBolt.jpg/600px-Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_BigWaterfallBottomRapBolt.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1345\" data-file-height=\"740\"></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/File:Jump_Trip_(Lower)_BigWaterfallBottomRapBolt.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Big waterfall, second stage anchor</div></div></div> \n\n<li><ul><li> Single bolts should generally be considered suspect and a meat anchor backup is recommended for all but <a href=\"/LAPAR\" title=\"LAPAR\" class=\"mw-redirect\">LAPAR</a>.</li>\n<li> Alternately, there is also an easy hike to bypass both stages of the big waterfall on LDC. Walk on slabs to the left. Do some butt scooting here and there. At the base of the first slab downclimb you should find the start of a trail. You can rappel 100' off a bush here into the pool below. Otherwise follow a trail on some terraces all the way around to a cliff wall on the left.  Use a hand line to climb down a corner crack far LDC against a rock wall.  There used to be a beautiful stand of pine trees at the base of this downclimb. Now, they are fallen logs that you have to climb over. </li></ul></li>\n<li> <b><a href=\"/Patterson_Creek\" title=\"Patterson Creek\">Patterson Creek</a></b>: It is easy to miss, but look for a light spray from this creek RDC across from the handline down climb.</li>\n<li> <b>Boulder Maze</b>: AKA The Final Slog.  The Boulder Maze is only about 160 yards long, but it feels much longer and probably is with all zigzagging and dead ends. It helps to be a really good climber or fresh with lots of energy in this section, but it comes at the end of the day when you will be dog tired. This is an easy section to injure an ankle or worse.  Spot and help each other. Generally, the easiest path is to go far LDC until you are past the first significant drop, then take a hard right, and stay RDC.  In low flows, the second half can be followed along the water course on RDC, but in higher flows, scrambling along the right side but to the left of the flow is easiest.  </li>\n<li> <b>Running Rock</b>: This is an alternate jump 15', RDC near the end of the Boulder Maze next to a narrow channel against the right side of the canyon.  You can just jump, but running down it seemed to be the thing to do in the early days, so it got that name.</li>\n<li> <b>Last Jump</b>: This is a final 30' jump into the pool below. Alternatively there is a handline (chain) on LDC where people climb up to go swimming and jumping.  You can use the existing rope to downclimb or rig your own rappel rope on the gigantic rebar anchors. From the pool below, climb the talus slope to a graded area.</li>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Water_flow_2\">Water flow</span>\n\nSafe water flow is approximately 12 cfs, but perhaps as high as 15 cfs for experienced and well-equipped canyoneers.  Winter and spring flows are often much higher than this, and releases from the Black Rock reservoir upstream have resulted in flows in excess of 6000 cfs.  4 cfs makes for an enjoyable trip, but without many serious class C challenges.\nGauge readings from the sensor in between <a href=\"/Jump_Trip_(Upper)\" title=\"Jump Trip (Upper)\">Upper Jump Trip</a> and Lower Jump Trip may be found at <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.dreamflows.com/graphs/day.450.php\">Dreamflows</a>.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Exit\">Exit</span>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bypass_trail\">Bypass trail</span>\n\nFrom the graded area by the powerhouse head directly over to the cliff LDC.  A rough path marked with a sign follows the base of the cliff steeply uphill until you can look down on the powerhouse.  At the high point, the trail meets a chain link fence. After 100' of elevation gain, the trail will begin to descend and will end across the street from the dirt parking area; head downhill on the outside of the fence to the parking area.  PG&amp;E employees spray the poison oak once a year or so, but don't otherwise maintain this trail.  If you have trouble finding the start of the trail, look farther up canyon where the shear rock wall meets the dirt section of the hill.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Alternate_Exit\">Alternate Exit</span>\n\nWhile at jump 6/18/15 some locals showed us how they do it. At the end we jumped the last pool and hiked down under the power station 140 yards and made another little jump 5'(be careful)and jumped back in the river and swam 160 yards along the powerhouse-when you see the water pouring out Balch PH start swimming over the shore just past the fence you'll see some old thick wire and Black Berry bushes and a piece of a downed wooded power pole next to a big brown rock-go up that trail and it will take to the road, about 40' from the cars. This route can save time and effort by eliminating the need to hike up the Balch powerhouse bypass trail.  However, one should exercise caution when attempting this route, as the discharge from Balch powerhouse can potentially create strong and cold currents that make the swim more challenging.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Express_Exit_2\">Express Exit</span>\n\nAbout 200 feet past the Matrix Jump is a corner of rock that is easy to scramble up at 36.89797, -119.06210.  Use the ledges on the left side until you reach a boulder where it's obviously been pruned.  Follow the path in the dirt and the cut plants up steeply past a short hand line to a flatter area (about 200 feet vertical up) Follow the rock cairns in the small clear areas and other trail markers under the Manzanita up another 600 feet vertical.  In the last 200 feet the path is not as well defined and traverses quite a bit left (down canyon) at time reaching the parking spot at 36.90200, -119.06223.  You gain about 900 vertical feet in 0.35 miles horizontal and you are only 0.6 miles on the road to the Express Drop-In point.\n\n\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:227px;\"><a href=\"/File:Jump_Trip_(Lower)_ExpressExitStart.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/7/72/Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_ExpressExitStart.png/225px-Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_ExpressExitStart.png\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/7/72/Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_ExpressExitStart.png/338px-Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_ExpressExitStart.png 1.5x, /images/thumb/7/72/Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_ExpressExitStart.png/450px-Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_ExpressExitStart.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"1300\" data-file-height=\"1732\"></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/File:Jump_Trip_(Lower)_ExpressExitStart.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Express Exit start climbing up here</div></div></div> \n\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:227px;\"><a href=\"/File:Jump_Trip_(Lower)_ExpressExitView.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/thumb/6/6b/Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_ExpressExitView.jpg/225px-Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_ExpressExitView.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/6/6b/Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_ExpressExitView.jpg/337px-Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_ExpressExitView.jpg 1.5x, /images/thumb/6/6b/Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_ExpressExitView.jpg/450px-Jump_Trip_%28Lower%29_ExpressExitView.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1536\" data-file-height=\"2048\"></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/File:Jump_Trip_(Lower)_ExpressExitView.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Express Exit: view looking back up canyon the Rainbow Room falls is clearly visible</div></div></div> \n\nList of coords for the Express Exit trail:\n\n36.89869, -119.06271\n\n36.89913, -119.06304\n\n36.89968, -119.06256\n\n36.89998, -119.06236\n\n36.90022, -119.06222\n\n36.90028, -119.06209\n\n36.90045, -119.06205\n\n36.90058, -119.06210\n\n36.90092, -119.06211\n\n36.90143, -119.06208\n\n36.90173, -119.06221\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape</span>\n\nThis canyon has been the site of many accidents and injuries.  To avoid unwanted scrutiny and possible future restrictions, please be extra careful to avoid the need for emergency services.\n\nThe water flow in this canyon is controlled by dam release from the Black Rock reservoir.  If the reservoir is close to full, this canyon can be extremely dangerous as large water releases are more likely under that circumstance.  This reservoir is visible from the south end of the campground and should be checked visually before beginning a descent. It may be possible to drive to the PGE Balch Camp HQ and/or call them at 559-487-6275 to confirm dam release plans. They also have free wifi at the Balch Camp HQ.\n\nPG&amp;E does not want anyone inside the fences of the power house.  Use the LDC bypass trail instead of attempting to cut through the power house grounds.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites</span>\n\nJuly 16, 2019\n\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/KHQYPV57gX0?\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n\n<li> <img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/a/ac/Rwl_en.png\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" data-file-width=\"24\" data-file-height=\"24\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://brennen.caltech.edu/swhikes/nkings.htm\">Chris Brennen's Adventure Hikes (Southwest)</a> &nbsp;: North Fork of Kings River</li>\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/FbgGI6pgbDU?\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/iKIlw7ID-lQ?\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</span>\n\nAreas near Jump Trip burned in the Rough Fire of 2015.  <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/michelle.nilles/media_set?set=a.1250236021669965.1073741913.100000507366132&amp;type=3\">This album</a> contains pictures soon after that fire.\n\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/F_kLpgDfwrs?\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/1UVWTy2KFXY?\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n\n<iframe src=\"//player.vimeo.com/video/31640024\" width=\"640\" height=\"493\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n\n<li> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_BLLdil66g\">Video from September 2011</a></li>\n<li> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://g-funk.smugmug.com/Sports/Canyoneering/Lower-Jump-Trip/10426893_h23B5#!i=722815253&amp;k=dYRLH\">Pictures from September 2009</a></li>\n<li> <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/madzoy/sets/72157606825745121/\">Pictures from 2008</a></li>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Background\">Background</span>\n\nPaul Martzen was an early pioneer of this route and has much additional background information.

The canyon is just 1/4 mile, but it requires a 20 mile hike and 5200ft elevation gain/loss. \nIt is definitely better done as part of a rafting trip down the Colorado river.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Approach\">Approach</span>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Descent\">Descent</span>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Exit\">Exit</span>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape</span>\n\nEntry to this area has been officially closed since 2012. Judging from Instagram posts, some rafting groups descend the canyon despite the closure. It is not clear if they are getting special permits or poaching the canyon, either way this seems the best and only way to run this canyon right now.

Be sure to read <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.canyoneeringusa.com/utah/zion/technical/preface/imlay-sneak-route/\">Tom Jones' preface to Imlay and Heaps</a> before attempting this canyon as it is a step above most other Zion canyons in difficulty.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Approach\">Approach</span>\n\nStart at the Grotto shuttle stop and head toward Angel's Landing.  Scout's Lookout is just after Walter's Wiggles, a set of 20+ steep switchbacks; at this point, continue up the West Rim trail.  Continue on the West Rim trail until it starts to descend and you cross a brige.  About 1000ft after the bridge, turn off the trail to the right at a large pine tree and cross the drainage below.  Contour along the left (west) wall as far as possible and then descend slightly to the drainage below.  Cross the drainage and climb the ridge that separates two separate drainages running north and find a use trail along the top of the ridge heading north.  When you reach a wall where the ridge becomes very steep, drop down into the drainage on the right (east) and continue north up the water course and on small use trails.  After about 220ft of elevation gain, reach a saddle and descend briefly then continue past the drainage exiting to the right -- this is Not Imlay.  Shortly after, ascend a somewhat tricky upclimb with a small use trail on the right, then a tree on the right side of the climb.  Continue upward for about 180ft of additional elevation gain until you reach another saddle.  Continue down the drainage keeping your eye on the right side.  When the terrain permits, contour onto the sandstone out of the drainage onto a large area of solid sandstone with a towering wall running east-west on the far side of Imlay Canyon.  Head just right of the sharp right-hand bend in the canyon after it gets narrow and look for a cairn, possibly with a sandal on it.  Continue your descent to the canyon bottom where you should find a broad, flat area of sand with somewhat over hanging rock.  If taking 2 days, bivy here.  You should reach this point 3.5-5.5 hours after starting.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Descent\">Descent</span>\n\nThe number of rappels will vary greatly depending on your conditions and your group's ability to downclimb. For most, 23 rappels. 14 in upper section. 9 in lower section. Second biggest rappel is about 60 feet which is the second to last rappel. Before this, next or third biggest rappel is about 45 feet.\n\nDownclimb and rappel a number of obstacles in well-lit semi-narrows.  One of the obstacles near the beginning of this section is a logjam that can be difficult to swim through and to climb.\n\nAfter a while, enter a set of very dark narrows.  After a few rappels, there will be a rappel that heads RDC initially and then turns LDC to open into a pool.  This is the first technical pothole and may require special equipment and techniques to escape -- be sure not to send too many people down before someone has escaped, and be sure to have the means to bring people back up to the top of the rappel to warm up if escape proves difficult.  After this pothole, a series of additional challenges follows before this narrow section ends.\n\nContinue down more open canyon until the start of another set of dark narrows.  After a few rappels, the narrows become brighter and there is a sequence of potholes, two of which may require technical escapes.  The longest rappel so far leads to a short hallway at the end of which the final rappel into the Narrows begins.  Rappel 120ft into the Narrows, likely in view of a number of tourists.\n\nThe technical descent will likely take at least 4 hours.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Exit\">Exit</span>\n\nPack up and head down the Narrows 1.5-2 hours to the Temple of Sinawava.

Very long and cold but relatively easy if potholes are full, it can become extremely difficult in adverse conditions.\n\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.canyoneeringusa.com/utah/zion/technical/preface/\">Tom Jones' preface to Heaps</a> is a must-read for those unfamiliar with its difficulty.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Approach\">Approach</span>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Descent\">Descent</span>\n\nSee one or more full beta pages (farther below) for more detailed information.\n\nThere are three sections of narrows, each about twice as long as the previous one.  Two of the trickiest parts seem to be near the end.  First, there is a dead-end hallway that can be confusing; the correct route is a crack with a log jam on the right looking toward the dead end:\n\n\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/File:Heaps_Canyon_DevilsPit.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Heaps Canyon DevilsPit.jpg\" src=\"/images/thumb/c/c6/Heaps_Canyon_DevilsPit.jpg/300px-Heaps_Canyon_DevilsPit.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/c/c6/Heaps_Canyon_DevilsPit.jpg/450px-Heaps_Canyon_DevilsPit.jpg 1.5x, /images/thumb/c/c6/Heaps_Canyon_DevilsPit.jpg/600px-Heaps_Canyon_DevilsPit.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1280\" data-file-height=\"960\"></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/File:Heaps_Canyon_DevilsPit.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div></div></div></div> \n\nSecond, to begin the final rappel sequence, climb up canyon right and then over the hill to the first rappel station at a tree.

{"URL":"https://ropewiki.com/North_Fork_Kaweah_River_(Lower)","Name":"North Fork Kaweah River (Lower)","Quality":5,"Latitude":36.6186,"Longitude":-118.9008,"Months":["August","September","October","November"],"Difficulty":"3c","Vehicle":"Passenger","Shuttle":"Required 90 min","Permits":"No permit required","Sports":["canyoneering"],"Time":"III","RappelCountMin":5,"RappelCountMax":6,"RappelLengthMax":110,"KMLURL":"https://ropewiki.com/images/2/28/North_Fork_Kaweah_River_%28Lower%29.kml","HTMLDescription":"<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Introduction\">Introduction</span>\n\nThe lower technical portion of the Kaweah, while maybe not quite as ridiculously cool as the upper part, is still really beautiful, with some definite technical challenge, and great slides and jumps.  \n\nIt is low elevation, and warm.  In hot summer days, you can do it without a wet suit, which is kind of awesome.  \n\nAlso, it makes for a great multiday trip when you combine it with the <a href=\"/North_Fork_Kaweah_River_(Upper)\" title=\"North Fork Kaweah River (Upper)\">Upper North Fork</a>, and perhaps <a href=\"/Stony_Creek\" title=\"Stony Creek\">Stony Creek</a> above that.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Approach\">Approach</span>\n\nLeave one car at the end of North Fork drive, (way up a curvy road from Three Rivers)\n\nDrive up Dry Creek road from Generals Highway and follow the signs to Hartland.  A mile or two before Hartland, take Pierce Valley road up on the right to Eshom Point OHV (this land mark can be input on your favorite navigation app). You have cell service here before descending the forest service road down to Cherry Flats.\n\nAs you drive up Pierce Valley road into Eshom Point OHV veer left on top of the hill to continue off the other side of the ridge.  Next intersection take a left on the dirt road that contours along.  I'd find somewhere to park here, but you can keep driving all the way down to Cherry Flats. The dirt road is easily traveled by 4x4's or a spirited driver in something akin to a Subaru Forester. \n\nMaybe 4 or 5 miles out on this road it drops down a ridge and you hit an intersection where a road goes left and one goes straight down the ridge.  Head straight, it will dead end quickly.  Up ahead at the dead end, what looks kind of like a drainage ditch is actually a trail, and will be fairly obvious once you get onto it.  There is poison oak, you cannot avoid it.\n\nFrom Eshom Point OHV at the top driving down to Cherry Flats (where the trail starts) takes about 45 minutes one way. You will be driving slow due to the overgrown vegetation attempting to give you beautiful manzanita pinstripes. Those driving the entire road in early season should expect downed trees or washed out deep ruts.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Descent\">Descent</span>\n\nThe trail drops you out at the confluence of the North Fork and Redwood Creek.  Just downstream the canyon starts with a 10 or 15 foot jump off a waterfall into a nice kind of grotto.  Further down more jumps and slides await.  \n\nThe technical portion becomes obvious and everything drops off down below you.  \n\nThere are a few bolts for the first (two staged) rappel just right of the water course on top of the drop which are a bit terrifying to get to.  These rappels keep you out of the water, and are okay with a decent amount of flow.  \n\nA short drop off I think a single bolt follows.  This puts you into a slot with some boulders jammed in.  If you have any doubts about the flow, you can climb out on the left before the next drop, walk downstream on the left and scope things out.  Otherwise you can rappel off these rocks (you'll probably need to build an anchor, as the water tears everything in here up).  If it looks bad, just bypass everything on the right, and find somewhere to rappel off the side of the final waterfall.  \n\nA little bit down from here you hit a rappel off of a tree on the left of a waterfall.  The next drop looks maybe downclimbable, but it is really slick, so probably not.  Also, the water all drives under a rock right after it.  When I did it, I slipped, and slid under the rock and out the other side.  It was pretty fun, but if the water was higher, you might die.  Something to consider?  \n\nAfter this one final rappel down a big beautiful waterfall of 100 feet or so into a wide pool finishes the technical portion.  \n\nThe fun is not entirely over though.  I could see some people seeing the next part as a slog, but I think it's mostly pretty great.  There are more slots, some you climb down, others have big waterfalls.  Most waterfalls are bypassed on the left, often by jumping back into the pool at the bottom.  Lots of swimming, your arms may get tired.  \n\nAs it starts to get more sloggy, you will see old rock work from an irrigation pipe.  A little while later there is a really fun low angle slide of 15 feet or so where it is obviously important to do the slide on the left.  Stop and play here as long as you like, it's time to get out of the river now.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Exit\">Exit</span>\n\nAfter playing in the slide, make your way up the steep grassy ridge on the left (east).  Bushwhacking is not terrible for the vast majority of the way up, until you get to the very end, at which point you may be belly crawling.  Don't worry though, the trail is close!  \n\nExcept maybe you should worry, because the trail is not maintained, and is equally bushwhacky in spots.  Sorry?  After the first mile and a half or so it gets better.  6 miles total down to your car, it takes a while, and will probably be unpleasantly hot.  There is not necessarily any water available, without bushwhacking back down to the creek.  Once you are quite close to your car, another path from Yucca Creek comes in from the left.  Another quarter mile down or so, you cross a bridge and come back up to the end of North Fork Drive and your car!\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape</span>\n\nThere is an alternate exit on the East that is shorter and on a dirt road that goes back to pavement. However, this is a private road and using it without permission would be trespassing. Please don't do that, it's not good for canyoneers to be caught trespassing. If you want to use this road try to contact the owner and get proper permission, otherwise stick to the official exit.\n\nYou can actually do this as a loop, and it is far more pleasant.  At the slide, if you go up the right (west) side you will find an old road, which can be connected to dirt roads to loop around nicely back up to your car.  This is all private property, so you shouldn't do it.  But you could.&nbsp;;)\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites</span>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</span>\n\nDumping this description of lower waterpark from Daniel Elson:\n\nI have a very clear memory of lower’s most technical section(starting at pic 88): \n\nslide, slide, jump, 10’ rap, “theoretically” scramble around DCL and slide right next to the waterfall, then 3 more slides(?),\n\nTHEN sketchy slide rick and I did unroped and we set up a hand line that we also used to rappel the two stage thru the sieve. In lower flow that hand-line wouldn’t be necessary, and it is probably a jump DCL and then a slide under the rock sieve.\n\nAfter that is a big waterfall (bolts DCL) that you can jump or slide from the halfway point.\n\nThat’s pretty much the entire technical section and pretty badass. One of my favorite all time sequences. Right before it there was a slide underneath a fallen tree.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Background\">Background</span>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Credits\">Credits</span></h2>\n<div id=\"idcredits\" class=\"notranslate\" style=\"display:none\">North Fork Kaweah River (Lower)</div>\n<div>Information provided by <span id=\"Pcredits\">automated processes</span>.

As the creek descends it produces a set of amazing waterfalls, the most famous being Havasu Falls.\nThis non-technical backpacking adventure will take you onto Indian land, down to the Indian village of Supai and beyond.\nMany hikers just hike the trail and enjoy the waters without knowing that there are many adventures to be had in this ancient land... if you know its secrets.\nThe information detailed in this beta will help you plan your visit and make you aware of some of the amazing spots that this area has to offer.\n\n<b>DISCLAIMER: Before entering a mine, cave or jumping off a cliff, remember to use your own judgement! Your safety is your own responsibility.  If something feels too dangerous or unsafe, don't do it!</b>\n\n<b>Special notes for Colorado River rafters in Red Tape section below</b>\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Approach\">Approach</span>\n\nHavasu Canyon is best visited over a long weekend, spending a minimum of 3 days and 2 nights down in the canyon. You can camp at the Havasupai campground (near the Havasu Falls) or you can stay at the lodge (in the Supai Village). Either way you will need reservations, preferably reserving 6 months in advance. You may need perseverance calling the Indian Reservation and sometimes the phones don't work at all. \n\nThe best season to go is September/October followed by May/June. During these months the weather is not too hot and the days are still long. June is packed with visitors, as most young backbackers are out of college. September is less crowded and easier to find nice campsites. July and August is monsoon season, it may rain a lot or camp may be closed or evacuated due to flash flood danger. In April and November days may be too short or it may be too cold to endure long exposure to the nice cool waters, which flow at constant temperature of 70F all year around. \n\nPlan your trip carefully, as there are limited facilities down at the Village of Supai. If you stay at the lodge you can go with just a day pack and have dinner there. If you stay at the campground you will need full backpacking gear and to carry food for several days. With advanced reservation you can arrange for mules to carry some of your stuff down (or back up) and then backpack with light loads. The hike down to Supai Village is 8 miles downhill (10 miles if going to the campground).\n\nOne can also take a Helicopter in or out from Supai Village. It costs $85 each way and it flies only on specific days of the week (best to call them to confirm). It is usually not worth it for the way in, but is a fantastic option for the way out as it saves 6 hours of uphill hiking and you'll be well rested for the drive home.\n\nFor more information and reservations go to <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://havasupaifalls.net\">http://havasupaifalls.net</a>\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"How_To_Get_There\">How To Get There</span>\n\n<a href=\"/File:Hilltop.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Hilltop.jpg\" src=\"/images/a/a5/Hilltop.jpg\" width=\"339\" height=\"158\" data-file-width=\"339\" data-file-height=\"158\"></a>\n\n\n<li> From Kingman to the Hualapai Hilltop is a 2-3 hour drive (130 miles)</li>\n<li> From Peach Springs to the Hilltop is a 1-1.5h hour drive (70 miles)</li>\n\nIt is recommended to drive out the evening before the hike down, spend the night in a motel or camp near the trailhead, and then start the hike the next day at dawn. The first half of the hike is in full sunlight and starting early will avoid the heat. It will also allow you to get to camp earlier than other visitors and claim a better camping spot for your group. The lower end of campground has nicer sites. East side (crossing creek) is usually quieter and fills up later. The south side of the campground is the last to fill up.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Motels\">Motels</span>\n\n<li>Grand Canyon Caverns: 5 miles east of turnoff 18, decent, closer to hilltop, with restaurant.

You can stop by on the way in or on the way back. In order to fully enjoy Havasu Canyon you will need at least 3 days, preferably more. A shorter itinerary might look like this:\n\n\n<li> First Day: Hike Down - Start at dawn, briefly stop at Havasu Spring, then bolt for camp to secure a nice site. After that go for a swim in Havasu Falls, explore the Crystal Mine. If you have time check out some of the other mines around camp or hike the Mesa Trail.</li>\n<li> Second Day: Waterfalls - Hike to Beaver Falls but take time to explore the interesting spots along the way. Go for a swim in Mooney Falls, stick to the wet route down to Beaver and try to find the Green and Blue rooms. If you are a small group you may have time to attempt the climb up the Vanadium mine or the hike down to the Colorado River still in daylight. But if you can afford it, it is better to allocate an extra day exclusively for the Colorado River hike.</li>\n<li> Third Day: Fly Back - Take it easy, pack camp and head for Supai Village. If you have time, stop to play at Havasu Falls, Rock Falls and New Navajo Falls along the way. Make sure you get to Supai by noon to catch the helicopter out. Reservations are not needed, but last flight is usually 1pm.</li>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Havasu_Springs\">Havasu Springs</span>\n\n<li>The source of Havasu Creek is very unique. To get to it you walk upstream about 1/4 mile from where Hualapai Canyon meets Cataract Creek. The easiest way to get there is to make a small detour on your hike in. When you first see Havasu Creek hike upstream for about 1/4 mile rather than following the signs pointing downstream. Small springs cover this area and together they make the large Havasu Creek.</li>\n<li>Around the spring area there is an ancient Indian cliff dwelling, look on the walls on canyon right (right looking downstream). It's not very obvious, but if you look for it you may find it.</li>\n<li>Watch for signs restricting access; this area may be inaccessible</li>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Supai_Village\">Supai Village</span>\n\n<li>You can refill bottles at a faucet on the east side of the Tourist Office building (right before helipad). </li>\n<li>Many opt to send postcards stamped with mules from Post Office (unique in the USA).</li>\n<li>Small Museum next to tourist office, you can ask at the office to give you access</li>\n<li>Be sure to check out the two smaller waterfalls above Havasu Falls proper (Rock Falls and New Navajo Falls), either on the way in or on the way out.</li>\n<li>The helicopter out of Supai only runs 2-4 days a week, make sure you plan accordingly. In my opinion this is the best return option. It costs $85 but allows you to spend an extra 1/2 day and save 6h of hiking time and have a killer helicopter experience too. If too expensive, the next best thing is to hire a mule to lighten your load so you can hike with a day pack. More info www.havasupaitribe.com</li>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rock_Falls\">Rock Falls</span>\n\n<li>Rock Falls is the Indian's favorite swimming hole. You can jump 30ft from the top of these falls in the pool below. </li>\n<li>There's a hidden rope you can grab to get to the very edge and then jump. I'm holding the rope in the picture.  </li>\n<li>You can also just skip the rope and take a run and jump. (just make sure you jump in the right spot).</li>\n<li>Summer flash floods change the canyon every year, make sure the falls are still safe to jump when you go</li>\n\n<a href=\"/File:Jump.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Jump.png\" src=\"/images/5/54/Jump.png\" width=\"240\" height=\"319\" data-file-width=\"240\" data-file-height=\"319\"></a> <a href=\"/File:Jump2.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Jump2.png\" src=\"/images/c/cf/Jump2.png\" width=\"240\" height=\"320\" data-file-width=\"240\" data-file-height=\"320\"></a>\n\n\n<li>Once you're done jumping don't forget to sneak into the back of the waterfall</li>\n\n<a href=\"/File:Back.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Back.png\" src=\"/images/b/b9/Back.png\" width=\"326\" height=\"204\" data-file-width=\"326\" data-file-height=\"204\"></a> <a href=\"/File:Back2.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Back2.png\" src=\"/images/5/59/Back2.png\" width=\"242\" height=\"322\" data-file-width=\"242\" data-file-height=\"322\"></a>\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"New_Navajo_Falls\">New Navajo Falls</span>\n\n<li>New Navajo Falls is a beautiful little Travertine grotto, very scenic.</li>\n\n<a href=\"/File:Navajo.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Navajo.png\" src=\"/images/2/2b/Navajo.png\" width=\"321\" height=\"191\" data-file-width=\"321\" data-file-height=\"191\"></a>\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Havasu_Falls\">Havasu Falls</span>\n\n<li>Some say it's forbidden to rappel the falls, but some people have done it and posted pictures online. The water is so strong that you have to rappel dry, out of the water. If you do so, be discreet and to avoid any confrontation with the Indians.</li>\n<li>Hike on top of the cliffs above the campground and beyond. You can get on top of the cliff by climbing up Ghost Canyon which is just beyond the cemetery as you are walking into the canyon and near the top of Havasu Falls.</li>\n<li>Short distance before the falls the trail branches off to the right to go to Carbonate Mesa Trail. This is a flat hike through nice sky terraces with sweeping views of Havasu Falls, camp and below. THIS IS NOT FOR A MIDDAY HIKE. 30-45min round trip, only do it if want to kill some time some afternoon and it's too cold to go play in the water.</li>\n<li>You can get behind Havasu Falls at the bottom pool, climb the rocks to a grotto 15ft up and jump off into the waterfall, having the falls push you under the water, then out toward the pools.</li>\n\n<a href=\"/File:Hfalls.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Hfalls.jpg\" src=\"/images/thumb/e/eb/Hfalls.jpg/250px-Hfalls.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/e/eb/Hfalls.jpg/375px-Hfalls.jpg 1.5x, /images/thumb/e/eb/Hfalls.jpg/500px-Hfalls.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"2736\" data-file-height=\"3648\"></a>\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Campground\">Campground</span>\n\n<li>Lower end of campground has nicer sites. East side (crossing creek) is usually quieter and last to flll up. Fern Spring at north end of camp is reliable (no treatment). South side of campground is the last to fill up.</li>\n<li>If you can't find a site with a table available, ask some other group if you can share one</li>\n<li>Hang food and trash from trees. Squirrels will chew through tents and packs to steal food.</li>\n<li>There are a few abandoned mines that you can explore right around camp. (see notes below)</li>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Crystal_Mine\">Crystal Mine</span>\n\n<li>This is the largest of the mines in Carbonate Canyon, adjacent to Havasu Falls, where rails and timbers still can be found descending three levels. Lead was mined here for the last time during WWII. Ranger Gale Burack, who worked at Grand Canyon, wrote of her experiences in the miners camp where the campground now resides (Arizona Highways, September, 1984). </li>\n<li>To get to the mine cross the rim of the Havasu Falls pool and get into Carbonate canyon, head 1/4 miles up canyon and on the right you'll find a big opening with a pipe sticking out, this is the entrance of the mine.</li>\n\n<a href=\"/File:Crystal.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Crystal.png\" src=\"/images/3/31/Crystal.png\" width=\"323\" height=\"241\" data-file-width=\"323\" data-file-height=\"241\"></a>\n\n\n<li>This a cool 3 level mine. Not trivial to navigate, but not too complicated to explore. Inside the mine there's a big shaft that crosses the 3 levels, but the bottom can be reached by an alternate route climbing down static ropes. </li>\n<li>Watch for a hole at ground level near some wood false floor (see picture), there will be a rope hanging here. Follow the rope down to reach 2nd level of the mine. It's a awkward climb, but not too hard to get out. Check that all of you will be able to climb back up BEFORE you climb down. If you can't, stay out.</li>\n\n<a href=\"/File:Crysta2.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Crysta2.png\" src=\"/images/6/61/Crysta2.png\" width=\"323\" height=\"239\" data-file-width=\"323\" data-file-height=\"239\"></a>\n\n\n<li>Bring a 30ft webbing or rope to descend from 2nd to 3rd level, since a rope is not always there. This climb is only for experienced adventurers because if you fall down you will be trapped in a water shaft full of rotten logs. If you happen to fall in and your buddies do not rescue quickly you may die of exhaustion or hypothermia or both. Double wrap webbing or rope around your hands and wear gloves for maximum friction. The climb is not that hard, but it is not for everyone either. Use your own judgment.</li>\n\n<a href=\"/File:Crystal3.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Crystal3.png\" src=\"/images/5/56/Crystal3.png\" width=\"318\" height=\"237\" data-file-width=\"318\" data-file-height=\"237\"></a>\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Another_Mine\">Another Mine</span>\n\n<li>Next to center of campground and visible from main trail on canyon left .</li>\n<li>Exposed climb required to access the 2 entrances, not very long, just one level, but cool.</li>\n\n<a href=\"/File:Moremines.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Moremines.png\" src=\"/images/2/2c/Moremines.png\" width=\"241\" height=\"324\" data-file-width=\"241\" data-file-height=\"324\"></a>\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mooney_Falls\">Mooney Falls</span>\n\n<li>Some say it's forbidden to rappel the falls, but some people have done it and posted pictures online. The water is so strong that you have to rappel dry, out of the water. If you do so, be discreet and avoid any confrontation with the Indians.</li>\n<li>It is possible to swim to the left of the falls to the rock wall, and then shimmy your way across the rock (while staying in the water) to a small cave that is located just above the water line, approximately 15–20 feet (5 to 6 meters) away from the falls (only attempt if you are a strong swimmer).</li>\n<li>There is an island located in the middle, which breaks the pool into two streams. Standing on this island allows for very dramatic pictures, as it looks you are engulfed by the waterfall.</li>\n\n<a href=\"/File:Mooney.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Mooney.jpg\" src=\"/images/thumb/a/aa/Mooney.jpg/250px-Mooney.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"/images/thumb/a/aa/Mooney.jpg/375px-Mooney.jpg 1.5x, /images/thumb/a/aa/Mooney.jpg/500px-Mooney.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"2736\" data-file-height=\"3648\"></a>\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ghost_Canyon\">Ghost Canyon</span>\n\n<li>deep and narrow burial canyon with a warm spring and 300ft walls just below Mooney. Great place to escape midday summer sun. Where Ghost canyon intersects Havasu creek it creates a grotto (set of pretty waterfalls)  on the west side of the Havasu creek.</li>\n<li>About 300 yards down from the Mooney Falls pool is a very cool cave on the left filled with ferns and water pouring down over the top. This is a great place to stop for a few pics and to cool off.</li>\n<li>About 1/4 of a mile down, there is a small stream which feeds into the creek, over the side of the cliff, effectively creating a place to shower. Follow the trail off to the right towards the creek, then back towards Mooney Falls a bit and you'll find this mini-waterfall. </li>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cataract_Mine_.2F_Vanadium_Mine\">Cataract Mine / Vanadium Mine</span>\n\n<li>On canyon left down from Mooney Falls, immediately after Ghost Canyon</li>\n<li>This mine requires a 256ft climb of a metal ladder to main entrance. The pipe ladder ascends to a vanadium deposit several hundred feet above the canyon floor. </li>\n<li>Near the top, barely visible in this image, are the words \"Enter the Dragon,\" presumably painted by a local tribe member.</li>\n<li>Historical reports says it's only 30ft deep tunnel and that the bottom part of ladder is missing since indian boys were injured climbing up to the mine. </li>\n<li>Climbing equipment recommended to attempt the ascent, will need to climb first section of ladder that is missing, see pictures below to get an idea</li>\n\n<a href=\"/File:Vanadium.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Vanadium.png\" src=\"/images/1/12/Vanadium.png\" width=\"238\" height=\"316\" data-file-width=\"238\" data-file-height=\"316\"></a> <a href=\"/File:Vanadium2.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Vanadium2.png\" src=\"/images/6/6c/Vanadium2.png\" width=\"203\" height=\"307\" data-file-width=\"203\" data-file-height=\"307\"></a> <a href=\"/File:Vanadium3.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Vanadium3.png\" src=\"/images/d/db/Vanadium3.png\" width=\"218\" height=\"292\" data-file-width=\"218\" data-file-height=\"292\"></a>\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Buddha_Cave\">Buddha Cave</span>\n\n<li>A short distance below Mooney, where the canyon is starting to narrow, the trail will go by a cave with a Buddha painting in it. </li>\n<li>You'll have to climb 6ft to get there, but it is easy. The cave provides shade and peace to visitors.</li>\n\n<a href=\"/File:Buddha.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Buddha.png\" src=\"/images/8/88/Buddha.png\" width=\"153\" height=\"204\" data-file-width=\"153\" data-file-height=\"204\"></a> \t \n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Jacuzzi_Spring\">Jacuzzi Spring</span>\n\n<li>A short distance down the canyons there is a spring that bubbles up creating a sort of natural jacuzzi in the middle of the river. You can recognize the location because it's immediately above a 10ft waterfall (see picture below). </li>\n<li>In the middle of the big pool at the top there is a massive water jet that push upward, very fun to \"body surf\" it!</li>\n\n<a href=\"/File:Jacuzzi.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Jacuzzi.png\" src=\"/images/3/3c/Jacuzzi.png\" width=\"320\" height=\"239\" data-file-width=\"320\" data-file-height=\"239\"></a> <a href=\"/File:Jacuzzi2.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Jacuzzi2.png\" src=\"/images/4/44/Jacuzzi2.png\" width=\"319\" height=\"238\" data-file-width=\"319\" data-file-height=\"238\"></a>\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rope_Swing\">Rope Swing</span>\n\n<li>A short distance down from the Jacuzzi Spring there used to be a rope swing that was really fun, but in 2012 I could not find it anymore. </li>\n<li>I was told the pool got too shallow after some flash flood, so it's no more. Still fun to look for it.</li>\n\n<a href=\"/File:Swing.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Swing.png\" src=\"/images/6/63/Swing.png\" width=\"152\" height=\"202\" data-file-width=\"152\" data-file-height=\"202\"></a> <a href=\"/File:Swing2.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Swing2.png\" src=\"/images/c/cf/Swing2.png\" width=\"286\" height=\"215\" data-file-width=\"286\" data-file-height=\"215\"></a>\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Beaver_Falls\">Beaver Falls</span>\n\nThese pools are small, but still offer good swimming. Like the previous three falls, there are many places to cliff-jump and there are many good sites to explore. \nMy suggestion is to visit the falls following the Wet route IN and the Dry route OUT. There are two underwater caves that are called the Green Room and the Blue Room. \n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wet_Route\">Wet Route</span>\n\n<li>If the group has an adventurous spirit take the “wet route” to Beaver Falls; if you choose this option there will be the opportunity to swim to the “Blue Room” -- an under water air pocket accessed by swimming beneath the first tier of the waterfall! Once you emerge from the green room, the thrill of discovering this canyon secret will help you steel your courage to JUMP off the main fall (18’) into the frothy pool below (have someone check depth first!)</li>\n<li>Once at the base at the falls you can engage in the hunt for the fabled Green Room, another underwater cave that is harder to get than the Blue Room. </li>\n<li>About 50 yards down from Beaver there is a cliff about 60 feet high that you can jump off of, you'll recognize it by the deep blue pool. If you jump it, there’s not an easy way to get back up…but it can be done.</li>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dry_Route\">Dry Route</span>\n\n<li>The trail will lead to a point where there appears to be no way to go, except for getting wet. But to the right, on the rock ledge, there is a rope hanging down (always test ropes you did not place before climbing them). Climb up this rope. It is a difficult climb of around 8 feet (2.4 m).</li>\n<li>In 2012 rope was replaced with a wood ladder that makes the climb very easy, both up and down</li>\n<li>Follow the trail up and follow it downstream. There is a rock chute/slide located to your left; this is the difficult access to the falls. There is an easier access point if you hike to the point just before the trail turns north to continue down the canyon. Look for ducks here. River rafters have beaten a path to the 60ft ledge where they jump. Go on upstream, gradually working your way to the creek bed. Climb down to the creek and the falls are just upstream. </li>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Blue_Room_.28Top_Tier_Beaver_Falls.2C_dive_3ft_down_and_6ft_in.29\">Blue Room (Top Tier Beaver Falls, dive 3ft down and 6ft in)</span>\n\n<li>Go to the top tier of the Beaver falls, start in from the left side and slip underwater and into a small cave. </li>\n<li>It is not very hard to get to as it is only a few feet behind the wall. Dive 3ft down and 6ft in into a small cave. </li>\n<li>You can feel the cave with your feet from the outside. Watch your head going in. From the inside, you can stick one foot out and help other people get in by letting them grab your leg and pulling them in. Watch their head.</li>\n<li>Red arrow below marks the location of the underwater entrance (notice the difference that a sunny vs cloudy day makes on water colors).</li>\n\n<a href=\"/File:Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_1.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Havasu Beaver Blue Room 1.png\" src=\"/images/2/25/Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_1.png\" width=\"324\" height=\"243\" data-file-width=\"324\" data-file-height=\"243\"></a> <a href=\"/File:Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_2.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Havasu Beaver Blue Room 2.png\" src=\"/images/8/84/Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_2.png\" width=\"324\" height=\"245\" data-file-width=\"324\" data-file-height=\"245\"></a>\n\n\n<li>No need for flashlight/headlamp inside this cave </li>\n\n<a href=\"/File:Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_3.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Havasu Beaver Blue Room 3.png\" src=\"/images/7/74/Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_3.png\" width=\"322\" height=\"240\" data-file-width=\"322\" data-file-height=\"240\"></a> <a href=\"/File:Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_4.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Havasu Beaver Blue Room 4.png\" src=\"/images/8/8a/Havasu_Beaver_Blue_Room_4.png\" width=\"321\" height=\"240\" data-file-width=\"321\" data-file-height=\"240\"></a>\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Green_Room_.28Bottom_Tier_Beaver_Falls.2C_dive_9ft_down_and_10ft_in.29\">Green Room (Bottom Tier Beaver Falls, dive 9ft down and 10ft in)</span>\n\n<li>Accessing the Green Room is not for everyone. It requires strong swimming skills and the aid of diving goggles/mask.</li>\n<li>We could not access the Green Room because pool was filled in from last flash flood (August 2012). Below are quotes from people that claims visited the fabled Green Room:</li>\n<li>'If you go to the beach at the base of beaver falls you will see an eddy current that brings you close to the fall. Enter that current and just before you would be hit with the fall dive under water. You should see a small cave under the water. It is not very large and will be very dark. Swimming into it is like a leap of faith. I can hold my breath for two minutes but was still very unnerved. Once inside the cave feel your way deeper for about ten feet or so. You will emerge without warning into a small air pocket. There is a small shelf you can stand on and there is only enough room for two people. Looking back the tunnel is a green color that lights up the cave.'</li>\n<li>'I found the \"Green Room.\" It was eight feet down and eight feet back approximately and not all that easy to find having no more than a pair of goggles to aid me in my search. It was much smaller than I would have thought, but enough area to get your head up and breath for a little bit. Since I went in the morning, it was also very dark and not green at all. Just search underneath a big underwater overhang under the large falls of Beaver.'</li>\n<li>'I learn that you can swim behind Beaver Falls, descend about 7', go through a large hole for about 8' then ascend the 7' to a small cavern. (Careful - there's a stalactite that ends not too far above surface level - be very careful ascending!) It's called the Green Room, because of the color of the light that passes through the water and is apparently quite beautiful with ferns surrounding you. Tom Cruise was there a few years ago.'</li>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"False_Green_Room_.28Bottom_Tier_Beaver_Falls.2C_marginal_diving_involved.29\">False Green Room (Bottom Tier Beaver Falls, marginal diving involved)</span>\n\n<li>There is another “Green Room” in the bottom falls . This Green Room isn’t a submerged room but it is a pocket behind a waterfall. Its fun to try to get into it. Enter it from the side and slip into the small opening grabbing on the rocks to push yourself inside. Once inside there were no strong currents, but there were some outside of the cave.</li>\n<li>To come out you can just dive down and let the waterfall flush you out, but <b>watch out for hydraulics</b>!</li>\n\n<a href=\"/File:Falsegreen.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Falsegreen.png\" src=\"/images/c/c4/Falsegreen.png\" width=\"242\" height=\"322\" data-file-width=\"242\" data-file-height=\"322\"></a> <a href=\"/File:Falsegreen2.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Falsegreen2.png\" src=\"/images/2/28/Falsegreen2.png\" width=\"323\" height=\"237\" data-file-width=\"323\" data-file-height=\"237\"></a>\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Past_Beaver_Falls\">Past Beaver Falls</span>\n\n<li>From Beaver Falls you can hike up and down Beaver canyon (1h strenuous climb up boulder strewn canyon, not sure it's worth it)</li>\n<li>From Beaver Falls you can hike 3 miles down to the confluence with the Colorado River (add 3h-5h more hours for the round trip). There are multiple ways to reach the Colorado, yet the best is to go back up the chute to the trail and follow that downstream. This spot is also popular for river rafters to stop and to head up the canyon.</li>\n<li>Stick to the trail (not the creek), follow the cairns and you'll do only 5 creek crossings. </li>\n<li>Colorado river is 7h-10h round trip from campground. If you want to do it be ready to leave predawn and come back in the dark, and do not expect to have much time to play in the waterfalls.</li>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Exit\">Exit</span>\n\nOptions for the return:\n\n\n<li> Leave camp at 4-5am for a grueling 10 mile hike uphill. (8 miles if leaving from lodge)</li>\n<li> Take it easy, play in the falls and time it to take the helicopter out at noon.</li>\n\nYou should arrive at the hilltop at about the same time. You might consider leaving a carefully packed cooler in the car with some dry ice and your favorite beverage to wait for your return.\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Red_tape\">Red tape</span>\n\nThere are several spots along the campground where picnic tables have been set <i>in the watercourse</i>. Most of the times these are there to aid crossing of the stream, but some of these tables also make for a fantastic \"pool bar\" where you can rest legs and feet in the cool water while having a post-hike Happy Hour with your friends. Remember that alcohol is forbidden in the Indian reservation. We drank from Gatorade and Vitamin Water bottles.\n\n<a href=\"/File:Poolbar.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Poolbar.png\" src=\"/images/f/fc/Poolbar.png\" width=\"212\" height=\"148\" data-file-width=\"212\" data-file-height=\"148\"></a> <a href=\"/File:Poolbar2.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Poolbar2.png\" src=\"/images/2/25/Poolbar2.png\" width=\"156\" height=\"208\" data-file-width=\"156\" data-file-height=\"208\"></a>\n\n<b>Special note for Colorado River rafters:</b> In 2018, during a 21-day rafting trip, we hiked up Havasu canyon after docking our boats at the confluence. We were stopped at Beaver Falls by a Havasupai guard with a walkie-talkie. He said that a daily entrance pass onto reservation land was $55pp, cash only. He would not take a credit card (we believed it would have been technically possible for him to call a cc number over his radio to charge from their office, but he would not try it). Although we had enough money back at the boats, there was no sign in the lower canyon advising us of the fee, and thus we did not know of it when we started the 3 mile hike up, so of course we did not have money on us. He turned all of our group back around the corner, out of sight of lower Beaver Falls. Keep this in mind if you are rafting and would like to visit the beautiful Havasupai land -- plan ahead either bringing cash or possibly arranging admission from the tribe in advance of your rafting trip (although timing the exact date of arrival during your rafting trip might be tricky).\n\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Beta_sites\">Beta sites</span>\n\n<li> <img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/a/ac/Rwl_en.png\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" data-file-width=\"24\" data-file-height=\"24\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://brennen.caltech.edu/swhikes/havasu.htm\">Chris Brennen's Adventure Hikes (Southwest)</a> &nbsp;: Havasu Canyon</li>\n<li> <img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/a/ac/Rwl_en.png\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" data-file-width=\"24\" data-file-height=\"24\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://toddshikingguide.com/Hikes/Arizona/GrandCanyon/Canyon8.htm\">ToddsHikingGuide.com</a> &nbsp;: Havasu Canyon</li>\n<li> <img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/a/ac/Rwl_en.png\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" data-file-width=\"24\" data-file-height=\"24\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://canyonchronicles.com/havasu-creek?kmlidx=217646538137783992549.0004e405e207c7a7551e2\">CanyonChronicles.com</a> &nbsp;: Havasu Creek</li>\n<li> <img alt=\"\" src=\"/images/f/f3/Book.png\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" data-file-width=\"16\" data-file-height=\"16\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://ropewiki.com/User:Grand_Canyoneering_Book?id=Havasu_Creek\">Grand Canyoneering Book by Todd Martin</a> &nbsp;: Havasu Creek</li>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Trip_reports_and_media\">Trip reports and media</span>\n\n<span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Background\">Background</span>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Credits\">Credits</span></h2>\n<div id=\"idcredits\" class=\"notranslate\" style=\"display:none\">Havasu Canyon</div>\n<div>Information provided by <span id=\"Pcredits\">automated processes</span>.
